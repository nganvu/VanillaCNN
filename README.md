# VanillaCNN

CNN for MNIST from scratch using only numpy.

Why? Currently, while there are a lot of materials on Convoluational Neural Networks available online, to my knowledge, none of them concretely derives how CNNs work and then implements a CNN using their derivation. This project aims to **concretely derives the math** behind Convolutional Neural Networks and then **implements an instance** of CNN using this derivation.

To run my implementation:
```
./vanilla_cnn
```

To run the Keras equivalence:
```
./keras_cnn
```
